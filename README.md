This video, but in real life. Also in Lithuania, not UK.

Lessons learned from Wordle: don't use a backend if you don't have to. All questions and answers are in static hosted JSON. This means it's not usable for anyone that wants to make an actual testing system out of this. I don't know why you would, but previous commits have a Rust backend (which doesn't work) with Google Sheets as a database (which is hilarious) [here](https://github.com/x-t/regitra-parody/tree/6ad23dad2284a48f70571239791b52a3f1f3fe4b).

Go take a test, I'm sure you'll ~~not~~ pass: [regitra.pages.dev](https://regitra.pages.dev).
