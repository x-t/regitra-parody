## History

Getting a driver's license is hard. This started out as a complete botch, as I was tired of learning the actual theory for the actual theory exam, but I started improving it after I finally got my driver's license and while the codebase is still not that pretty, I got it to a state where I'm actually totally happy and call this a project, not a throaway joke.
